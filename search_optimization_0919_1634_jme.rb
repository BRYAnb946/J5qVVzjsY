# search_optimization.rb
# This is a Ruby program that optimizes search algorithms using the CUBA framework.

# Load the required CUBA framework
require 'cuba'

# Define a class for search optimization
class SearchOptimization < Cuba
  # Define a route to handle search requests
  define do
    # On GET request to the root path, perform the search optimization
    on root do
      # Access the search query from the params
      search_query = params[:query]
      
      # Validate the presence of the search query
      if search_query.nil? || search_query.empty?
        res.write "Error: Search query is missing or empty."
        status 400
        return
      end
      
      # Perform the search optimization logic here
      # For demonstration purposes, we'll just echo back the search query
      optimized_query = "Optimized: #{search_query}"
      
      # Respond with the optimized search query
      res.write optimized_query
    end
  end
end

# Run the CUBA app
SearchOptimization.run!
